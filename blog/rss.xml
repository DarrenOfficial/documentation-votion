            <description><![CDATA[So I thought I would write a bit of a plan for the Music Man rewrite. It is currently made in discord.js v12 and uses message commands. Since discord upadted their API to slash commands and interactions, that is what it will now be using. It will use discord.js v13 with Sharding. Most of the commands have already been added and you can check on its progress with the bot "jamies testing bot". The bot uses lavalink to be able to stream music as it is very efficient and sounds very good. We plan to have a few music events with the bot aswell like on stages as kareoke nights or just coding and listening to music. If you do have any suggestions for events, ping me in the suggestions channel with it.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[As of 22nd December 2021, Dashactyl 0.4 will be EOL (End Of Life). This is because it is now outdated software and has critical security flaws. It has developed many bypasses over its time and will no longer recieve security updates. Please do not try and ask for support in the discord as it will just be ignored and removed. If you continue to do so, moderators will take action. The Github repository has been set to Public Archive but will continue to stay in the orginisation and is not planned to be deleted.]]></description>
