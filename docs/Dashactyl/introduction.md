# Introduction

Dashactyl is a client area control panel that allows users to split the resources given to them into different servers. They can create as many servers as they are given, and have Ram, Disk and CPU limits. The client area uses [pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io) as the game panel and utilizes its API to create the servers and users.

Dashactyl uses Discord Authentication, allowing you to not have to store passwords. It is also easy to use and very user friendly.

If you encounter any issues installing Dashactyl, [join the discord](https://discord.gg/nDxrPWh8pk) and use one of the dedicated support channels to ask your question.
